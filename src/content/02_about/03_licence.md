The Publican code and associated themes can be used, adapted, and distributed as you wish without restriction or payment.

I only ask you consider:

1. My time. I cannot offer unlimited or unpaid support, updates, fixes, meetings, consultancy, etc. I am [available for hire](https://craigbuckler.com/), though.
1. My liability. I am not liable for any problems or losses you encounter while using the Publican code, [Publican.dev](--ROOT--), documentation, themes, or related materials.
1. You acknowledge and promote your use of [Publican](https://www.npmjs.com/package/publican), perhaps with a link on your website.
1. Contributing your own ideas, assets, code, fixes, etc. [to the Publican community](https://github.com/craigbuckler/publican).
1. A [project donation](https://donate.publican.dev/) or [Github sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/craigbuckler) especially if you use Publican or a theme in a professional or commercial capacity.
